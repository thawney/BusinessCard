# Thawney's Ultimate Business Card Of Businessynes

Ello! Thawney here :D this is my business card. It is a very simple design based on the atari punk console that gives the user a pitch and modulation knob and control voltage input and can be powered from a 9v battery.

It is recommended to use alpha 9mm potentiometer but any will do! The audio/cv in jacks are thonkicon (WQP518MA). If you are Bristol based then come and visit Bristol Communal Modular on a Tuesday, they might have some spares.

!!NOTE!! If you are one of the lovely people who came to my Dorkbot Bristol talk on 11/06/2024 then the business cards I gave you have the potentiometers wired backwards for pitch and modulation, I'm sorry D:

# Hacking the Card

There are a lot of fun hacks you can do! For example, the potentiometers are wired as variable resistors which means you can replace them with fun resistors (Like LDRs or Thermistors) and control the card in new fun ways.

To do this just ensure that you are placing the legs of your components in pins that ARE NOT already connected with the components!

If you want to do something less technical, try heating up or cooling the chip on the circuit board to mess with the tuning!
